                <p><em>Open data is publicly available data that can be universally and readily accessed, used, and redistributed free of charge. Open data is released in ways that protect private, personal, or proprietary information. It is structured for usability and computability. (extracted from a <a href="http://thegovlab.org/open-data-whats-in-a-name/" target="_blank">comparison of open data definitions</a>)
                </em></p>
                <p>It is important to recognize that this is a somewhat idealized version of open data. In truth, few forms of data possess all the attributes included in this definition. The openness of data exists on a continuum, and while many forms of information may not be strictly open in the sense described above, they may nonetheless be shareable, usable by third parties, and capable of effecting wide-scale transformation. The Open Data’s Impact repository explores case studies that leverage data across this continuum.</p>

                <h4>Objectives</h4>
                <p>Despite global commitments to and increasing enthusiasm for open data, little is actually known about its use and impact. What kinds of social and economic transformation has open data brought about and what is its future potential? How—and under what circumstances—has it been most effective? How have open data practitioners mitigated risks and maximized social good?Even as proponents extol the virtues of open data, the field suffers from a lack of detailed evidence of the impact of open data, and what contributed to the impact.</p>
                <p>The Open Data’s Impact repository seeks to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide a more nuanced understanding of the various processes and factors underlying the demand, supply, release, use and ultimately impact of open data. </li>
                    <li>Assess and provide evidence for the premise that open data has the potential to impact society in a variety of beneficial ways;</li>
                    <li>Provide actionable insights to policymakers, civil society representatives, entrepreneurs, researchers and others seeking to release or use open data.</li>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column medium-3"><h3>How Did We Study It?</h3></div>
            <div class="column medium-8 end">
                <h4>Methodology</h4>
                <p>Part of the reason we know so little about open data is because there have been so few systematic studies of its actual impact and workings. The field is dominated by conjectural estimates of open data’s hypothetical impact; those attempts that have been made to study concrete, real-world examples are often anecdotal or suffer from a paucity of information.</p>

                <p>Through this repository the GovLab aims to build a more systematic study of open data and its impact by rigorously examining several case studies from around the world. These case studies are chosen for their geographic and sectoral representativeness. They are built not simply from secondary sources (like news reports and academic papers) but from extensive interviews with key actors and protagonists (see below) who possess valuable and thus far untapped on-the-ground knowledge. In addition, the case studies seek to go beyond the descriptive (what happened) to the explanatory (why it happened, and what is the wider relevance or impact).</p>

                <p>In order to provide these explanations, we have assembled an analytical framework that applies across case studies and allows us to present some more widely applicable principles for the use and impact of open data. Impact—a better understanding of how and when open data really works—is at the center of our research. Our framework seeks to establish a taxonomy of impact for open data initiatives, outlining various dimensions (from improving government to creating economic opportunities) in which open data has been effective. In addition, the framework lays out some key conditions that enable impact, as well as some challenges faced by open data projects. </p>
                <h4>Open Peer Review</h4>
                <p>In the spirit of openness that defines the field under examination, the GovLab open-sourced the peer review process of our open data case studies and key findings paper. Rather than sharing drafts only with a select group of experts we made our report and each of the case studies openly accessible for review in the interest of gaining broad input on our findings and collaboratively producing a common resource on open data’s impacts for the field.</p>
                <p>During the monthlong open peer review process, more than two dozen people from around the world shared their input as Recognized Peer Reviewers through in-line comments and in-depth responses to the ideas and evidence presented in the Key Findings Paper and case studies. Additionally, the paper and case studies were made openly accessible to the public, allowing anyone to share suggestions, clarifications, notes on potential inaccuracies and any other useful input prior to publishing. Much of this input was integrated into the final versions found here.</p>

                <div class="column medium-8 end">
                    <p>The case studies were conducted by the GovLab under the leadership of Andrew Young and Stefaan Verhulst, and in close collaboration with Laura Bacon of Omidyar Network.  In addition, Becky Hogge contributed 6 case studies focused on the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>As an action research center, the GovLab designs, tests and studies technology, policy and strategies for fostering more open and collaborative approaches to governance working with public partners. We work on open data both to the end of advancing research but, first and foremost, to accelerate innovation in the field.</p>
